# Live Project

# Introduction
For the last two weeks of the first Live Project at The Tech Academy, I worked on a project with my peers in a team developing a MVT Web Application in Django/Python.
Working with a team was a great learning experience and opportunity to familiarize myself with creating branches and making sure no bugs/merge conflicts occured. Most of my time was spent creating my own part of the main project which required me to quickly adapt to how the main project was structured. During the two week sprint I quickly got a glimpse of how a good developer works with a team and how to manage their time to be the most efficient they can be, from the daily standups which was a great way of keeping track of how everyone was doing on the project to even sharing roadblocks and hearing what problems other developers ran into. I worked on several backend stories which built my confidence in making every part of the Web Application functional and I was able to further enhance my knowledge on the MVT side of Django.
